Q1. Why we chose the sleeper density model for speed calculation?

Q2. How to determine the sleeper density?

Presentation sequence(15 minutes):

1-> What is the need of image analysis for speed detection? (1 minute)

2-> Mention about the two solutions for speed calculation (30 seconds-1 minute)

3- (Atul)> Mention why we chose PSC (Pre Stressed Concrete) sleeper detection 

4-> Brief idea on PSC sleepers (sleeper density) (3-5 minutes) (including point 3 and 4)

5-> Logic/calculation (Detailed flow chart) (2 minute)

6-> Practicality of the prototype

7-> Business Model (2 minute) (including point 7 and 8)
